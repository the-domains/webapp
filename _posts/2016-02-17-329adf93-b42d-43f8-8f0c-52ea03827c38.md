Fixed a couple of bugs!

* There was bug that confused the loading state for no content, and would always show the "make your first post" message on load. Now that's fixed, so you'll see a loading indicator when your site / post info is loading from the server.
* Another bug caused image uploads to fail in a new post. That works much better now.
